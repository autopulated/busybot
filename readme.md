Busybot is a flexible proof of work challenge, that can be used to require
clients to expend time and energy solving a hard cryptographic problem before
accepting their requests. The solution to the challenge can be quickly and
easily verified.

This can be used to protect expensive server functions from overloading by
bots, by imposing a real cost on the bots prior to making the requests.

The challenge cannot be parallelised, or solved dramatically faster on a GPU or
specialist hardware than on a normal CPU.

It is serially compute bound (not memory intensive), and busybot includes
optimised implementations of to both solve and verify challenges in pure JS
with no dependencies.

## Usage:
```npm install --save busybot```

On the server (e.g. [express](https://expressjs.com) or [fastify](https://fastify.dev) app):
```js
import { generate, verify } from 'busybot';
import express from 'express';
import session from 'express-session';

const app = express();
app.use(session({secret:'changeme'}));
app.use(express.json());

// an endpoint for clients to fetch a fresh challenge:
app.get('/get/a/challenge', async function(req, res) {

    // generating a challenge is asynchronous: it might have to wait for
    // the crypto randomBytes API to have enough entropy:
    const challenge = await generate({forMersenneExponent:4253, withDifficulty: 100});
    req.session.challenge = challenge;

    // the challenge is a plain javascript object that is json-serialisable:
    res.send(challenge);
});

// an endpoint protected by the challenge
app.post('/your/expensive/endpoint', function(req, res, next) {
    if ((!req.session.challenge) || !verify(req.session.challenge, req.body.solution)) {
        res.status(401);
        res.send('you must solve the challenge to call this endpoint');
    } else {
        // prevent re-using the challenge (assuming your session is resistant to replay)
        delete req.session.challenge;
        // all good, proceed do do expensive work here...
        res.send('well done, you did the work :)');
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => { console.log(`Busybot example listening on :3000`) })
```

On the client, solve it:
```js
import { solve } from 'busybot';

// receive the challenge from the server however you like, e.g.
const challenge = (await (await fetch('locahost:3000/get/a/challenge')).json());

// solve it: this will take several seconds depending on the specified
// difficulty. If you're doing this in a web page you might want to use a Web
// Worker
const solution = solve(challenge);

// make the expensive request that requires the challenge
const expensiveResult = await fetch('/your/expensive/endpoint',
    {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({solution})
    }
);
```

## Background
Busybot is an implementation of a more general version of the proof of work
scheme used by kCTF
(https://github.com/google/kctf/blob/v1/docker-images/challenge/pow.py), to
impose expensive work on pesky bots before serving their requests.

This implementation is pure js, with no run-time dependencies, and
compatible with any browser or js environment with BigInt support
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)

The ability to vary the mersenne exponent used as the base for the challenge
allows it to be adapted to a very wide range of difficulties (from ms to
minutes of work).

## Mathematical Details
We have a modulus m, which is a Mersenne prime (2^n -1) (kCTF uses n=1279.
but the ratio of difficulty of solving the challenge vs verifying it is
directly correlated to n, so use a larger n for more difficult challenges)

The challenge is for the client to perform a series of modular square roots
on some random value, provided by the server, flipping a bit between each
multiplication to prevent trivial shortcuts.

For the server to verify the challenge, it will square the result, flipping
the same bits between each step, and check if it gets back to the correct
initial value. Squaring is much faster to calculate than the square root (in
this implementation, about 3000x for n=3217).

Since Mersenne primes have remainder 3 mod 4, the square root step consists
of the calculation, x ^ ((m + 1)/4), from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelliâ€“Shanks_algorithm.

It is worth mentioning that only half of the numbers between 0 and m have a
square root, but this scheme applies the calculation x ^ ((m + 1)/4)
indiscriminately to any number. If some x does not in fact have a square
root, then the result of squaring the result is instead, -x (mod m). So even
after any number of operations, we can only be out by a factor of -1 (this
is why the verify step checks the final result against -x as well as x.)

For the squaring step in the verification, since a Mersenne prime is a
simple sum of 2^n - 2^0, the Barrett reduction of the square operation is
very cheap, consisting only of a few adds and shifts.


## Why this Proof-of-Work Scheme is Useful
This proof of work scheme is useful over a hash-collision type scheme, or
memory-bound scheme because it is resistant to parallel implantation, not
memory intensive, and predictable in duration largely varying only by single
core processing speed, and the speed of the closest few KB of cache. This makes
it 'fairer' for a wide range of devices.

A client with significant parallel GPU compute cannot calculate a solution
dramatically faster or cheaper than a client with a single core processor.
(And these reasons appear to be why it was chosen for kCTF too
https://github.com/google/kctf/commit/b770fad71304cb060475c98bcabd2e150d217ad0)

This scheme does of course cause all clients to 'waste' time and energy,
it's suggested to impose it only on a high rate of requests from a single ip
address, where it can avoid otherwise denying service to genuine users who
are sharing a connection: a group of 100 students in a school sharing the
same ip address are not significantly hampered by each having to wait 10
seconds for an important request, but a single abusive client making 100
requests would have to spend 15 minutes of computing time for the privilege.
